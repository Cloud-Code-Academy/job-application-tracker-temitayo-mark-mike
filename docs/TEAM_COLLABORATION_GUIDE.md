### **üé® Team Development Standards**

#### **üìù Coding Conventions**
```apex
/**
 * Team Coding Standards Example
 * 
 * @description Service class for job application management
 * @author [Developer Name]
 * @date [Date]
 * @group Job Application Management
 */
public with sharing class JobApplicationService {
    
    // Constants in UPPER_CASE
    private static final String DEFAULT_STATUS = 'Applied';
    private static final Integer MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 200;
    
    /**
     * @description Creates job applications with proper validation
     * @param applications List of job applications to create
     * @return List of created job application IDs
     * @throws JobApplicationException when validation fails
     */
    public static List<Id> createJobApplications(List<Job_Application__c> applications) {
        // Input validation
        if (applications == null || applications.isEmpty()) {
            throw new JobApplicationException('Applications list cannot be null or empty');
        }
        
        // Business logic
        validateApplications(applications);
        
        try {
            insert applications;
            return getIds(applications);
        } catch (DmlException e) {
            throw new JobApplicationException('Failed to create applications: ' + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    // Private helper methods
    private static void validateApplications(List<Job_Application__c> applications) {
        for (Job_Application__c app : applications) {
            if (String.isBlank(app.Company_Name__c)) {
                throw new JobApplicationException('Company name is required');
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **üß™ Testing Standards**
```apex
/**
 * Team Testing Standards Example
 */
@isTest
public class JobApplicationServiceTest {
    
    @TestSetup
    static void setupTestData() {
        // Create test data using factory pattern
        List<Job_Application__c> testApps = TestDataFactory.createJobApplications(5, 'Applied');
        insert testApps;
    }
    
    @isTest
    static void testCreateJobApplications_Success() {
        // ARRANGE
        List<Job_Application__c> newApps = TestDataFactory.createJobApplications(3, 'Applied');
        
        // ACT
        Test.startTest();
        List<Id> createdIds = JobApplicationService.createJobApplications(newApps);
        Test.stopTest();
        
        // ASSERT
        System.assertEquals(3, createdIds.size(), 'Should create 3 applications');
        
        List<Job_Application__c> verifyApps = [
            SELECT Id, Company_Name__c, Status__c 
            FROM Job_Application__c 
            WHERE Id IN :createdIds
        ];
        System.assertEquals(3, verifyApps.size(), 'All applications should be in database');
    }
    
    @isTest
    static void testCreateJobApplications_NullInput() {
        // ACT & ASSERT
        try {
            JobApplicationService.createJobApplications(null);
            System.assert(false, 'Should throw exception for null input');
        } catch (JobApplicationException e) {
            System.assert(e.getMessage().contains('cannot be null'), 'Should have meaningful error message');
        }
    }
}
```

## üîÑ **Git Workflow for Teams**

### **üåø Branching Strategy**
```bash
# Main branches
main          # Production-ready code
develop       # Integration branch for features

# Feature branches (short-lived)
feature/salary-calculator-enhancement
feature/interview-scheduler-mobile
bugfix/task-creation-issue
hotfix/security-vulnerability

# Team workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on your feature...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add salary calculation validation"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request to develop branch
```

### **üìù Commit Message Standards**
```bash
# Format: type(scope): description

feat(salary): add tax calculation for multiple states
fix(scheduler): resolve calendar conflict detection bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(triggers): add comprehensive trigger test coverage
refactor(api): improve error handling in external calls
perf(queries): optimize job application search query
```

## üë• **Team Communication Strategies**

### **üìÖ Meeting Structure**

**Format**: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any blockers?

**Example**:
```
Developer A: "Yesterday I completed the salary calculator validation. 
Today I'm working on the mobile responsive design. 
No blockers."

Developer B: "Yesterday I worked on the API integration tests. 
Today I'm debugging the timeout issue we discussed. 
Blocked on: Need access to the staging API environment."

Tech Lead (You): "Yesterday I reviewed PRs and updated documentation. 
Today I'm helping with the API issue and planning the next sprint. 
I'll get you staging access after this meeting."
```

#### **üîç Code Review Sessions (30 minutes, 2x/week)**
**Focus Areas**:

#random              # Team bonding and fun
```

#### **üìã Documentation Standards**
**Decision Records**: Document important technical decisions
```markdown
# ADR-001: Choose LWC over Aura for New Components

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build new UI components for the job tracker.

## Decision
Use Lightning Web Components (LWC) for all new development.

## Consequences

- User experience improvements
- Mobile responsiveness
- UI testing

**Developer B (Backend Focus)**:
- Apex development
- API integrations
- Data processing
- Security implementation

### **üìä Skill-Building Assignments**
**Beginner Tasks** (Good for learning):
- Add new fields to existing objects
- Create simple validation rules
- Write unit tests for existing code
- Update documentation

**Intermediate Tasks** (Skill building):

- [ ] Code does what it's supposed to do
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

## Quality
- [ ] Code follows team standards
- [ ] Methods are focused and well-named
- [ ] Comments explain why, not what
- [ ] No code duplication

## Testing
- [ ] Adequate test coverage (>85%)
- [ ] Tests are meaningful and comprehensive
- [ ] Test data setup is clean

## Security
- [ ] CRUD/FLS permissions checked

- [ ] Governor limits considered
```

### **üí¨ Review Feedback Examples**

**‚úÖ Constructive Feedback**:
```
"Great work on the salary calculation logic! Consider extracting the tax 
calculation into a separate method for better testability. Also, we should 
add validation for negative salary values. What do you think?"
```

**‚ùå Unhelpful Feedback**:
```
"This is wrong. Fix it."
```

**‚úÖ Learning-Focused Feedback**:
```
"This works well! For future reference, using a Map here instead of nested 
loops would improve performance from O(n¬≤) to O(n). Want me to show you 
an example in our next pairing session?"
```
