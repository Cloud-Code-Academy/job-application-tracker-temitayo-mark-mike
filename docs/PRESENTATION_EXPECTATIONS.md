# Presentation Expectations

**Overview**  
The main goal of this presentation is to showcase what the team has created according to the capstone project requirements through coding and the knowledge gained during the course. It serves as a platform for team members to present their creations and articulate the challenges faced and the solutions developed. Different segments of the presentation are designed to cover the user-centric features, delve into the technicalities, and promote reflective discussions.  
One guiding principle should be: would you use this system or would you put it into your production org?

**Part 1 (20 minutes) - User-Centric Features and Configuration:**

* Present the functionalities constructed as if introducing them to someone who would use the org. This may include end-user, declarative, and programmatic demonstrations.   
* Delve into the organization's setup, configuration, and any intriguing features or "behind-the-scenes" elements.  
* The format should resemble a training session or a product demonstration, with emphasis on practicality and user interaction.

**Part 2 (20 minutes) - Code Deep Dive:**

* Transition into the technical aspects by showcasing the code behind key features.  
* Every team member is expected to discuss at least one section of the code.  
* Highlights should include the construction methodology, intriguing code segments, and potential enhancements for future iterations.  
* This segment will adopt an interview project review or code review format, fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.

**Part 3 (10 minutes) - Instructor Questions:**

* The instructor will probe deeper, inquiring about the data model and the code's architecture.  
* This session may involve constructive critiques, identification of potential vulnerabilities, and suggestions for future improvements.

**Part 4 (10 minutes) - Reflections and Conclusions:**

* The team will collectively share reflections about the project, focusing on team dynamics, collaboration, and the overall journey.  
* The instructor will provide concluding remarks, summarize observations, and impart final thoughts.

**Execution Protocol:**  
While a singular team member can manage the screen sharing for consistency, it's imperative that each participant articulates their contributions, elaborating on their design decisions and implementation rationale.  
**Evaluation Criteria:**  
Post-presentation, the rubric provided will guide the scoring process for both the presentation and the codebase. Please allow 7 day window post-presentation for the final scoring to be communicated.  
A total of **68 points**, as outlined in the rubric, are required to pass the capstone project successfully.  
**Additional:**

* The session will be recorded so the team can review how they performed and improve.  
* Guests who are not your instructor may join the capstone presentation to add a different perspective but will only leave comments in the live session chat.  
* Revisions to the codebase will be allowed for up to 1 week after the presentation is complete.

# Rubric

**Total: 100/100 Points**  
68 points are required to pass along with no significant bad practices in the codebase.  

## 1. Data Model and Setup (5 Points)

* Identification and justification of standard vs.custom objects used (2 points)  
* Proper configuration of fields (including data types and relationships) (1 point)  
* Logical and efficient record page design using standard and custom components (1 point)  
* Best practices followed in data modeling and object relationships (1 point)

## 2. Code Review (40 Points)

* Clarity and organization of code (8 points)  
* Best practices followed in Apex, LWC, and other components (8 points)  
* Proper error handling and data validation (7 points)  
* Efficient class, method, and variable names; meaningful comments in the code (7 points)  
* Complex requirements/functionality Apex/Integration/LWC (10 points)

## 3. Demonstration (25 Points)

* Working functionality of the system (10 points)  
* Handling of edge cases and unexpected inputs (10 points)  
* Presentation organization and flow (3 points)  
* Enhancements beyond scope/requirements provided (2 points)

## 4. Testing (15 Points)

* Comprehensive unit tests covering at least 75% of the Apex code (6 points)  
* Bulk record tests and positive/negative test scenarios (5 points)  
* Proper mock calls and assertions in test classes (4 points)

## 5. Collaboration and Version Control (10 Points)

* Effective use of GitHub for version control (4 points)  
* Relevant metadata committed to the repository (3 points)  
* Evidence of collaboration among team members (3 points)

## 6. Q&A Session (5 Points)

* Ability to answer questions about the code and design choices (3 points)  
* Ability to handle feedback and suggest improvements (2 points)

Note: This rubric is a guideline, and instructors can adjust the point allocations based on their emphasis and priorities. ​​All sections of the rubric may not apply to your specific project.  
If you fail to meet the points necessary to pass, your team may be required to present again.  
Teams will have one week after the presentation to make any revisions to their codebase and submit for an additional code review by the instructor.  
*Points will automatically be taken off for showing the developer console. - this is a joke, but also not a joke*
