**Hey team! 👋**

Following up on our discussion about aligning our data models - I've put together a comprehensive **Data Dictionary** that documents all the custom objects and fields I've implemented so far.

**📊 [Complete Data Dictionary](docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md)**

This covers:
- ✅ **Complete field specifications** (15+ fields with types, lengths, requirements)
- ✅ **Security model recommendations** (permission sets, field-level security)
- ✅ **Validation rules** (business logic enforcement)
- ✅ **Automation framework** (trigger-based task creation)
- ✅ **Future enhancement ideas** (additional objects, fields)

**🎯 Key Highlights:**
- **Job_Application__c** as our primary custom object with **23 custom fields**
- **7 status values** covering the full application lifecycle (Saved → Applying → Applied → Interviewing → Negotiating → Accepted → Closed)
- **Complete tax calculation system** (Federal, Social Security, Medicare, Take-Home Pay)
- **Market analysis fields** for salary competitiveness tracking
- **Rating system** (1-5 scale) for interest level tracking
- **3 validation rules** for data integrity and business logic
- **Primary Contact lookup** to Contact object for relationship management

**🤝 What I need from you:**

1. **Review the field list** - Are we missing anything critical?
2. **Check the picklist values** - Do the status options cover all scenarios?
3. **Validate the security model** - Does this approach work for our needs?
4. **Suggest improvements** - What would you add/change/remove?
5. **Naming conventions** - Are the API names clear and consistent?

**💡 My thinking:**
I wanted to create a solid foundation that we can all build on, but I definitely want your input before we lock this in. Better to align now than refactor later!

**⏰ Timeline:**
Once we're aligned on the data model, we can move forward with:
- Individual feature development on our branches
- Automation and business logic implementation  
- UI/UX components and user experience
- Integration and testing

**🚀 Git Strategy:**
Totally agree with Mike's approach (main = production, individual branches). I'm thinking:
- `main` - Production ready code
- `temitayo/data-model` - My current work
- `mike/[feature]` - Mike's development
- `mark/[feature]` - Mark's development

**📅 Meeting Coordination:**
I'm flexible on timing - work/family keeps me busy but this project is a priority. I can make most evenings work with a bit of notice, and weekends are usually good too.

**Side note:** Also prepping for PD1 - great timing to reinforce these concepts! 📚

**Please take a look at the data dictionary and let me know your thoughts!** Looking forward to building something awesome together! 💪

**P.S.** - The data dictionary is designed to be our "single source of truth" for the schema, so once we align on this, we can all implement consistently across our orgs.
