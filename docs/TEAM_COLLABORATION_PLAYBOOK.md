# 🤝 Team Collaboration Playbook
*From Solo Mastery to Team Leadership - Your Guide to Successful Collaboration*

---

## 🎯 **Your Journey: Solo Expert → Team Leader**

You've mastered the technical foundations solo, and now you're ready to become the technical leader your team needs. This playbook will help you transition from individual contributor to collaborative leader.

## 🧠 **The Knowledge Transfer Strategy**

### **🎓 Your Role as the Technical Mentor**

You're not just a team member - you're the **Subject Matter Expert** who will guide your teammates to success. Here's how to leverage your deep knowledge:

#### **The "Teach to Learn" Approach**
```
Your Deep Knowledge → Simplified Explanations → Team Understanding → Collective Success
```

**Why This Works:**
- Teaching reinforces your own understanding
- Creates shared knowledge across the team
- Builds trust and leadership credibility
- Ensures project continuity

## 📚 **Knowledge Sharing Toolkit**

### **🎯 Architecture Walkthrough Template**

**Use this structure when explaining our system to teammates:**

#### **1. The Big Picture (5 minutes)**
```
"Our Job Application Tracker has three main layers:
1. Data Layer: Custom objects and fields
2. Logic Layer: Triggers and Apex services  
3. User Layer: Page layouts and (soon) Lightning components"
```

#### **2. The Trigger Framework (10 minutes)**
```
"Think of our trigger like a restaurant kitchen:
- Trigger = Order comes in
- Handler = Head chef who decides what to cook
- Services = Specialized chefs (one for tasks, one for taxes, one for contacts)"
```

#### **3. Hands-On Demo (15 minutes)**
```
"Let me show you what happens when we create a job application..."
[Live demo in the org]
```

### **🎯 Code Review Checklist for Team**

**When reviewing teammate's code, check for:**

#### **✅ The "SOLID" Principles**
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Does each class do one thing well?
- **O**pen/Closed: Can we extend without modifying existing code?
- **L**iskov Substitution: Are our inheritance patterns correct?
- **I**nterface Segregation: Are our interfaces focused?
- **D**ependency Inversion: Do we depend on abstractions?

#### **✅ Salesforce Best Practices**
```apex
// ✅ GOOD: Bulkified operation
List<Task> tasksToInsert = new List<Task>();
for (Job_Application__c job : jobApps) {
    tasksToInsert.addAll(createTasksForJob(job));
}
insert tasksToInsert;

// ❌ BAD: DML in loop
for (Job_Application__c job : jobApps) {
    insert createTasksForJob(job);
}
```

#### **✅ Testing Standards**
- Test class exists and follows naming convention
- Positive and negative test cases
- Bulk testing (200+ records)
- Proper test data setup
- Meaningful assertions

## 🚀 **Parallel Development Strategy**

### **🎯 How to Split Work Effectively**

#### **Option 1: Feature-Based Split**
```
You: Lightning Web Components + Calendar Validation
Teammate 1: Jooble API Integration
Teammate 2: Email Reminders + Data Cleanup
```

**✅ Pros:** Clear ownership, minimal conflicts
**❌ Cons:** Uneven complexity, potential integration issues

#### **Option 2: Layer-Based Split**
```
You: Architecture oversight + complex Apex
Teammate 1: Lightning Web Components + UI/UX
Teammate 2: Testing + Documentation + Deployment
```

**✅ Pros:** Leverages individual strengths
**❌ Cons:** Requires more coordination

#### **Option 3: Pair Programming Approach (Recommended)**
```
Week 3: You + Teammate 1 on LWC (You lead, they learn)
Week 4: You + Teammate 2 on API (You guide, they implement)
Week 5: All three on testing and polish
```

**✅ Pros:** Knowledge transfer, quality assurance, team bonding
**❌ Cons:** Slower initial development

### **🎯 Git Workflow for Team Success**

#### **Branch Strategy**
```
main (production-ready code)
├── feature/lwc-salary-calculator (your work)
├── feature/jooble-integration (teammate 1)
└── feature/email-reminders (teammate 2)
```

#### **Merge Process**
1. **Feature complete** → Create pull request
2. **Code review** → At least one teammate reviews
3. **Testing** → All tests pass
4. **Integration testing** → Test with other features
5. **Merge** → Squash and merge to main

---

## 🎯 **Communication Protocols**

### **📅 Daily Standup Template**

**Each team member shares:**
1. **Yesterday:** What I completed
2. **Today:** What I'm working on
3. **Blockers:** What's stopping me
4. **Help Needed:** Where I could use support

**Your role as technical lead:**
- Identify integration points
- Suggest solutions to blockers
- Coordinate dependencies
- Share relevant learnings

### **📝 Technical Decision Documentation**

**Use this template for major decisions:**

```markdown
## Decision: [Title]
**Date:** [Date]
**Participants:** [Team members involved]

### Context
What problem are we solving?

### Options Considered
1. Option A: [Description, pros, cons]
2. Option B: [Description, pros, cons]
3. Option C: [Description, pros, cons]

### Decision
We chose Option X because...

### Consequences
- Positive: [Benefits]
- Negative: [Trade-offs]
- Mitigation: [How we'll handle downsides]
```

## 🛠️ **Development Environment Setup for Team**

### **🎯 Ensuring Consistency**

#### **Shared Development Practices**
```json
// .vscode/settings.json (shared)
{
    "salesforcedx-vscode-apex.enable-sobject-refresh-on-startup": true,
    "salesforcedx-vscode-apex.java.memory": "-Xmx4096m",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "apex.format.enable": true
}
```

#### **Code Style Guidelines**
```apex
// Class naming: PascalCase with descriptive names
public class JobApplicationTriggerHandler {
    
    // Method naming: camelCase with action verbs
    public void beforeInsert(List<Job_Application__c> newRecords) {
        
        // Variable naming: camelCase, descriptive
        List<Job_Application__c> recordsNeedingCalculation = new List<Job_Application__c>();
        
        // Constants: UPPER_CASE with underscores
        private static final Decimal SOCIAL_SECURITY_RATE = 0.062;
    }
}
```

### **🎯 Org Management Strategy**

#### **Individual Development Orgs**
```
Each team member has their own scratch org or developer org
↓
Regular sync with shared "integration" org
↓
Final deployment to "demo" org for presentation
```

#### **Metadata Synchronization**
```bash
# Daily sync routine
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default
sf apex run test --result-format human
sf data export tree --query "SELECT Id, Name FROM Job_Application__c LIMIT 5" --output-dir sample-data
```

---

## 🎯 **Conflict Resolution Strategies**

### **🤝 Technical Disagreements**

#### **The "Spike Solution" Approach**
When teammates disagree on implementation:
1. **Time-box exploration** (2-4 hours each)
2. **Build proof of concepts** for each approach
3. **Compare results** objectively
4. **Make data-driven decision**

#### **The "Architecture Review" Process**
```
1. Present the problem to the whole team
2. Each person explains their approach (5 min each)
3. Discuss pros/cons as a group
4. Vote or reach consensus
5. Document the decision
```

### **🤝 Merge Conflicts**

#### **Prevention Strategy**
- **Communicate early** about what files you're changing
- **Small, frequent commits** rather than large changes
- **Regular pulls** from main branch
- **Clear file ownership** during development

#### **Resolution Process**
```bash
# When conflicts occur
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts in VS Code
# Test thoroughly
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```
