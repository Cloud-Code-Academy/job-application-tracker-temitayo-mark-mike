# 🚀 AUTOMATED APP VISIBILITY FIX

## 🎯 **ONE-CLICK SOLUTION!**

I've created **3 automated scripts** that will fix everything for you automatically!

## 🖱️ **Choose Your Platform**

### **Windows PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Run this single command in PowerShell
.\scripts\auto-fix-app-visibility.ps1
```

### **Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
# Run this single command in Command Prompt
scripts\auto-fix-app-visibility.bat
```

### **Mac/Linux Bash**
```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x scripts/auto-fix-app-visibility.sh
./scripts/auto-fix-app-visibility.sh
```

## 🎯 **What the Automation Does**

### **✅ Automatic Checks**
- Verifies you're in the correct project directory
- Confirms Salesforce CLI connection
- Checks current app visibility status

### **✅ Automatic Deployments**
- Deploys updated permission set with app visibility
- Deploys custom application metadata
- Deploys utility bar configuration
- Runs complete project deployment

### **✅ Automatic Configuration**
- Assigns Job Application Manager permission set
- Configures app visibility permissions
- Verifies all deployments successful

### **✅ Automatic Verification**
- Runs diagnostic checks before and after
- Opens Salesforce org automatically
- Provides success confirmation

## 🚀 **Super Quick One-Liner**

If you just want to fix it NOW, run this single command:

### **Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default; sf org assign permset --name Job_Application_Manager; sf org open
```

### **Mac/Linux**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default && sf org assign permset --name Job_Application_Manager && sf org open
```

## 📱 **After Running the Script**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+R)
3. **Click App Launcher** (9 dots icon)
4. **Search "Job Application Tracker"**
5. **Click the app** - it should appear! ✅

### **Success Indicators**
- ✅ App appears in App Launcher
- ✅ Navigation shows: Home, Job Applications, Contacts, etc.
- ✅ Utility bar at bottom with Notes, History
- ✅ Professional branded interface

## 🔧 **If Automation Fails**

### **Manual Backup Commands**
```bash
# Deploy everything
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default

# Assign permission set
sf org assign permset --name Job_Application_Manager

# Check assignment
sf data query --query "SELECT PermissionSet.Name FROM PermissionSetAssignment WHERE AssigneeId = '${USER_ID}'"

# Open org
sf org open
```

### **Alternative Access Methods**
1. **Direct Tab**: Look for "Job Applications" tab in navigation
2. **Global Search**: Search "Job Application" in Salesforce search
3. **Setup Access**: Setup → Object Manager → Job Application
